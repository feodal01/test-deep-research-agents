Initially, tally marks were used before the use of numbers. Let [...] ### Definition of Numbers  An arithmetic value that is expressed using a word, a symbol or a figure that represents a quantity is called a number.

Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with 1 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.) However, in the 19th century, set theorists and other mathematicians started including 0 (cardinality of the empty set, i.e. 0 elements, where 0 is thus the smallest cardinal number) in the set of natural numbers. Today, different mathematicians use\\n\\n[8] List of types of numbers - Wikipedia\\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers\\nSnippet: Algebraic number: Any number that is the root of a non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients.

Trigonometric number: Any number that is the sine or cosine of a rational multiple of π. [...] Even and odd numbers \\\"Parity (mathematics)\\\"): An integer is even if it is a multiple \\\"Multiple (mathematics)\\\") of 2, and is odd otherwise.

I've a vague idea that it's unknown whether or not it's possible, but I don't keep up to date on it.  Last time someone asked about the subject, I found a couple of relevant papers, although that question wasn't identical to this question:  How to sort in-place using the merge sort algorithm? [...] ``` qsort = lambda a: [] if not a else qsort(filter(lambda x: x<a[len(a)/2], a)) + filter(lambda x: x == a[len(a)/2], a) + qsort(filter(lambda x: x>a[len(a)/2], a))  ```  For a discussion about stable/unstable sorting, look here .

Merge sort and heapsort run in worst-case O(n log n) time, and quicksort runs in expected O(n log n) time. One wonders if there’s something special about O(n log n) that causes no sorting algorithm to surpass it. [...] Runtime The ﬁrst and third for loop take Θ(k) time, and the other two for loops take Θ(n) time. So overall the algorithm takes Θ(k + n) time. When k = O(n), this beats the comparison sort lower bound of Ω(n log n), because it is not a comparison sort. Counting sort uses the values of the elements, instead of relying on comparisons between them. [\\n\\n[3] Worst case $O(n \\\\ln n)$ in place stable sort?\\nURL: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2569/worst-case-on-ln-n-in-place-stable-sort\\nSnippet: Any unstable sorting algorithm can be made stable, by adding the original relative positions of the objects being compared as a tie-breaker in the comparison function. This can be done without any extra memory if you are already sorting array indices, as a way to avoid moving the actual objects around; otherwise it's an O(n) extra memory technique.  If this technique is applicable, then you can use it with heapsort to get a stable O(n log n) in-place sort for free.

O(n^2) sorting: Bubble sort, Selection sort, and Insertion sort  O(nlogn) sorting: Merge sort, Quicksort, Heapsort. Note: The worst-case performance of Quicksort is O(n^2), but it works very fast in O(nlogn) time on average.  In addition to comparison operations, these sorting algorithms also use other types of operations.\\n\\n[5] Is it possible to have a sorting algorithm with worst case O(1) time ...\\nURL: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-have-a-sorting-algorithm-with-worst-case-O-1-time-complexity\\nSnippet: \\\"en.wikipedia.org\\\") > A comparison sort cannot perform better than O(n log n) on average.( \\\"en.wikipedia.org\\\")  Worst case is not better than average, so worst case can also not have O(1) time complexity.  You can compare with non-comparison algorithms that can be less than O(n\\\\log(n)), but none listed there are O(1).  Hope this helps and does not mislead or confuse you.  William Steinberg  M.S. from Syracuse University  ·  Author has 3.8K answers and 2.5M answer views   ·   3y [...] It’s hard to write an algorithm that is better than O(n\\\\log n) - never mind O(n). O(log n) would be fantastic. O(1), you’d need hardware that can sort large number of elements “in one go”.  Even checking that all elements are in correct order would be O(n) - I don’t think there’s a way to improve on that.

If you are looking for integer solutions, x,y,z = 0 is a trivial solution.  Another set of trivial solutions is where z = 0 and x + y = 0 or where x = 0 and z = y or where y = 0 and x = z.  However, as Leonhard Euler proved there are no solutions to x^3 + y^3 = z^3 where x,y,z are unique positive integers.  Update: [...] The equation x3+y3=z3 is a specific case of Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that there are no three positive integers x, y, and z that satisfy the equation xn+yn=zn for any integer n>2.  In the case of n=3, it has been proven that there are no positive integer solutions.

It can only be written as 152+102,12+182,62+172. One can verify this by observing that if a2+b2=325, then we may assume WLOG that a≤b so that 2a2≤325⇒a≤12. Thus it suffices to find the values of a that are at most 12 and such that 325−a2 is a perfect square. It could be useful to list the first few perfect squares: 0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169,196,225,256,289,324.

As of 2014( this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to  Weaker statements than this have been proven; for example, Vinogradov's theorem [...] says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes).

Mercury(I) Ion: Mercury can exist in two oxidation states, +1 (mercury(I)) and +2 (mercury(II)). In the +1 oxidation state, mercury ions pair up to form a diatomic ion, written as Hg₂²⁺. This is because each mercury ion has a +1 charge, so two Hg⁺ ions bond together to create the Hg₂²⁺ ion.  2. Chloride Ion: Chlorine forms a -1 charge as Cl⁻.  3. Balancing Charges: Since Hg₂²⁺ has an overall charge of +2 and each Cl⁻ has a -1 charge, we need two chloride ions to balance the charge: [...] Hg₂²⁺ + 2Cl⁻ → Hg₂Cl₂  So, the chemical formula for mercury(I) chloride is Hg₂Cl₂.

This statement is based on which theory?\\n\\n    SOURCES:\\n    [1] Central Limit Theorem Explained - Statistics By Jim\\nURL: https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/central-limit-theorem/\\nSnippet: Let’s get more specific about the normality features of the central limit theorem. Normal distributions have two parameters, the mean and standard deviation. What values do these parameters converge on?  As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution converges on a normal distribution where the mean equals the population mean, and the standard deviation equals σ/√n.  Where:   σ = the population standard deviation  n = the sample size [...] Let’s put all of this together. As sample size increases, the sampling distribution more closely approximates the normal distribution, and the spread of that distribution tightens. These properties have essential implications in statistics that I’ll discuss later in this post.

Table of contents [...] We will denote by the sample mean of the first terms of the sequence:  When the sample size increases, we add more observations to the sample mean.  Note that the sample mean, being a sum of random variables, is itself a random variable.  ## Convergence to the normal distribution  The Central Limit Theorem tells us what happens to the distribution of the sample mean when we increase the sample size.

Larger samples are more accurate because CLT also proves that the distribution of the sample mean will have the mean as the population mean, and the standard deviation will reduce with increasing sample size. This theorem forms the basis for many. All types of mean distributions tend to converge to a Normal Distribution as the sample size [...] The Central Limit Theorem in Statistics states that as the sample size increases and its variance is finite, then the distribution of the sample mean approaches the normal distribution, irrespective of the shape of the population distribution.  ## Central Limit Theorem Formula  Let us assume we h\\n\\n[4] 7.2: Using the Central Limit Theorem - Statistics LibreTexts\\nURL: https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Statistics/Business_Statistics_(OpenStax)/07%3A_The_Central_Limit_Theorem/7.02%3A_Using_the_Central_Limit_Theorem\\nSnippet: We consider three examples of very different population distributions and the evolution of the sampling distribution to a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The top panel in these cases represents the histogram for the original data. The three panels show the histograms for 1,000 randomly drawn samples for different sample sizes: n=10, n=25 and n=50. As the sample size increases, and the number of samples taken remains constant, the distribution of the 1,000 sample means becomes [...] Figure 7.2.4 shows a sampling distribution.

Thus, as the sample size approaches infinity, the sample means approximate the normal distribution with a mean, µ, and a variance, . As shown above, the skewed distribution of the population does not affect the distribution of the sample means as the sample size increases.

He made fundamental advances in computer architecture, algorithms, formalization of computing, and artificial intelligence.

They are among the most common types of volcanoes; more than 700 stratovolcanoes have erupted lava during the Holocene Epoch (the last 11,700 years), and many older, now extinct, stratovolcanoes erupted lava as far back as Archean times. Stratovolcanoes are typically found in subduction zones but they also occur in other geological settings. Two examples of stratovolcanoes famous for [...] A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a typically conical volcano built up by many alternating layers (strata) of hardened lava and tephra.
