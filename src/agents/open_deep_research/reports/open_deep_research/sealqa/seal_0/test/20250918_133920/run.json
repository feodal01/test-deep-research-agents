Previously, collaborators had to be credited with at least one-third of the album's duration to be eligible. This rule change, which reverts to a pre-2017 policy, aims to reflect the collaborative nature of contemporary music production, particularly in genres like rap and R&B. As a result, nominations for future albums could include a significantly larger number of creators. The Academy's decision arrives shortly after it voted to remove nomination review committees that previously determined award contenders. For the 2022 Grammys, albums released between September 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021, will be eligible.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nThe Academy announced Wednesday that any producer, songwriter, engineer or featured artist on an album nominated for album of the year will also earn a nomination. The change reflects how the Grammys handled album of the year before 2017. For instance, if Justin Bieber’s “Justice” is nominated, more than 50 creators will be nominated for the project. The change greatly affects rap, R&B and some pop albums, where songwriters and producers typically vary throughout the project.\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 4: Grammy Rule Change for Album of the Year: Impact - Billboard ---\nURL: https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/grammy-rule-change-album-of-the-year-9640388/\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nThe 2022 Album of the Year Grammy nominations are notably crowded due to recent changes in eligibility rules by the Recording Academy. Previously, only artists credited with at least 33% of an album's playing time were nominated, but now, anyone involved in the album's production—including featured artists, songwriters, and engineers—is eligible.

Winners of Grammy awards, such as Adele and Fleetwood Mac, often experience significant increases in album sales and are more likely to experiment with innovative sounds in their subsequent projects. In contrast, artists who are nominated but do not win tend to produce more conventional music that aligns closely with existing genre norms, a phenomenon termed 'silver medal syndrome'. The study, conducted over five decades of Grammy history, highlights the dichotomy in artistic evolution post-nomination and suggests that the award system may inadvertently stifle creativity among near-winners. Researchers emphasized that although Grammy victories can provide artists with the confidence and resources to push boundaries, these experimental works do not always achieve commercial success.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nWinning a Grammy impacts your ability to attract attention, thereby getting you better deals, said Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. Grammy winners typically maintain their genre but innovate after winning. Conversely, nominated artists who do not win often create less unique music. The phenomenon known as 'silver medal syndrome' could make musicians second-guess their instincts, leading to more conventional sounds.\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 8: How Grammy Wins and Losses Shape Artists' Creative ... ---\nURL: https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/how-grammy-wins-and-losses-shape-artists-creative-trajectories\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nA new study by Prof. Balázs Kovács of Yale School of Management analyzes how Grammy wins and losses influence artists' creativity. Over six decades of data, the researchers found that Grammy winners tend to explore new musical directions after their win, whereas nominees who do not win often become more conformist in their styles. This suggests that recognition may foster creativity for winners but can stifle nominees. The study measured stylistic differentiation and sonic attributes of artists' albums and concluded that the presence of awards could have a negative effect on creativity within the music industry.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nWinners often branched out in creative new directions, whereas nominees who didn’t win tended to play it safe. 'The net effect is actually negative,' Kovács states. Winning a Grammy might grant artists the freedom to experiment, while nominees may feel pressured to conform to popular styles to succeed next time.\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 9: How Winning (or Losing) a Grammy Changes the Music ... ---\nURL: https://behavioralscientist.org/how-winning-or-losing-a-grammy-changes-the-music-artists-make/\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nA study published on February 13, 2023, by Giacomo Negro, Balázs Kovács, and Glenn Carroll in the *American Sociological Review* examines how winning or losing a Grammy affects music artists' subsequent work. The research reveals that after winning a Grammy, artists often explore more innovative and stylistically diverse music, while those who lose tend to produce more mainstream, conventional albums. The researchers analyzed Grammy nominations and wins from 1959 to 2018, involving 1,036 artists, and found that winners generally have more leverage to pursue their artistic inclinations compared to nonwinners, who may feel pressured to conform to genre norms. The study also highlights that nominations boost album sales and production resources, but winners and losers diverge in how they utilize these resources, impacting the overall creativity within the music industry.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nWinning a Grammy prompts creativity and innovation, while nominations alone result in conformity. After winning a Grammy, artists tend to release music that deviates stylistically from their own previous work. Nonwinning nominees show greater similarity to other artists in their subsequent recordings.\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 10: I think it's time the Grammy Awards becomes more inclusive. ---\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/187p5xg/i_think_its_time_the_grammy_awards_becomes_more/\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nA Reddit user expresses concerns about the lack of inclusivity at the Grammy Awards, observing a predominance of recognition for white artists.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) outlines specific criteria for airlines wishing to join, including the requirement for air transport enterprises to hold a valid Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) registration. IATA\\'s total membership dues for 2025 amount to USD 12.6 million, with an application process that typically takes 3-4 weeks for processing. Once the receipt of funds for the annual dues has been confirmed, applications will be submitted to the IATA Director General for approval ([1](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/4d47f6bdd293422fafdc2266a02b3941/iata-membership-application-procedure.pdf)).\\n\\n2. Membership is open to airlines maintaining IOSA registration and operating scheduled and non-scheduled air services. IATA represents approximately 350 members, which carry 80% of the world’s air traffic. Benefits of membership include unified advocacy, reduced operational costs, and opportunities for involvement in key industry initiatives aimed at achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 ([2](https://www.iata.org/en/about/members/)).\\n\\n3. The IOSA program is a globally recognized system that enhances airline safety and efficiency through standardized audits based on internationally harmonized standards covering eight operational safety areas, including flight operations and aircraft maintenance. All IATA members must remain IOSA-registered, performing audits every two years to maintain their status. IOSA is supported by the IOSA Oversight Committee, which ensures compliance and quality control across the auditing process ([13](https://skybrary.aero/articles/iata-operational-safety-audit)).\\n\\n4. The IOSA program has shifted to a risk-based approach, focusing on pertinent safety risks while maintaining a baseline of safety. This transition aims to improve audit effectiveness and contribute to lower accident rates. A maturity assessment is introduced to evaluate the airlines\\' safety systems more comprehensively ([1](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/safety/audit/iosa/about-iosa/)).\\n\\n5. Airlines must undergo IOSA audits, which require that they comply with 916 standards aimed at improving safety performance. The audit results are documented and play a crucial role in managing risk and ensuring ongoing compliance with safety practices ([2](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/safety/audit/iosa/)).\\n\\n6. Adhering to IATA standards is essential for operational safety and compliance within the aviation sector. Organizations must comply with IATA regulations to benefit from improved safety measures, industry recognition, and operational efficiencies. This applies to airlines, airports, and ground handling companies ([11](https://www.industrialcompliancesafety.com/safety-compliance/what-is-the-international-air-transport-association-iata/)).\\n\\n7. The IATA Health Safety Standards Checklist is designed to assist airline operators with self-assessments relating to health safety management, including emergency response protocols and compliance with evolving regulations, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic ([9](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/5c8786230ff34e2da406c72a52030e95/health-standard-checklist-for-airline-operators.pdf)).\\n\\n8. IATA emphasizes the importance of global standards for ground handling and operations to enhance safety, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency. Training initiatives for optimizing aircraft operations have been introduced to maintain accurate standards ([12](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/ops-infra/ground-operations/ground-ops-standards/)).\\n\\n**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**\\n1.

Founded in April 1945 in Havana, Cuba, IATA is headquartered in Montreal, Canada, with an executive office in Geneva, Switzerland and 63 offices worldwide. The organization's mission is to represent, lead, and serve the global aviation industry by developing standards, advocating for member airlines, and providing essential support services. IATA offers various membership types for airlines—Active, Associate, and Allied—and also provides opportunities for related industry partners, including travel agencies and freight forwarders. IATA's core functions include setting tariffs, regulating airline operations, and maintaining high service standards within the aviation sector.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nIATA was founded in Havana, Cuba in April 1945 as the prime vehicle for inter-airline cooperation.

Koffler, published in the Journal of Air Law and Commerce (1966), examines the International Air Transport Association (IATA), its regulatory framework, and the implications of its cartel-like structure on international airfares. IATA was established following the Chicago Conference in 1944 to regulate air commerce among nations, yet its practices raise concerns about market competition and fare independence. Koffler elaborates on how IATA’s rate-setting authority often leads to artificially high airfares, facilitated by agreements among its airline members, undermining the potential for competitive pricing that would benefit consumers. The article further discusses the institutional dynamics within IATA, highlighting the role of Traffic Conferences in rate determination, which operate under a veto system that empowers each member to block proposals unilaterally. The author challenges the justification for IATA's exemption from U.S. antitrust laws, suggesting that reforms are needed to balance competitive practices with regulatory oversight. As international air commerce evolves, Koffler argues for a restructuring of IATA to ensure it aligns more closely with market demands while addressing governmental concerns about monopoly practices.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nIATA is an international monopoly, or cartel, by either classic or modern definition. The success of IATA was born out of the failure of the Chicago Conference on International Aviation. IATA’s practices lead to higher fares that could be considerably lower in the absence of its regulation. The primary function of each traffic conference is to establish rates for its geographic region. IATA has been called an exercise in 'professional para-legislation.'\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 11: Corporate Governance - IATA ---\nURL: https://www.iata.org/en/about/corporate-structure/\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) serves as a collective authority for its members, focusing on strategic leadership through its Board of Directors supported by nine Advisory Councils. Annual General Meetings (AGM) provide a platform for member airlines to exercise governance by reviewing the Board's reports, approving amendments to by-laws, and confirming appointments. IATA maintains a structured advisory system with councils aimed at addressing key industry challenges and promoting best practices.

Industry-wide revenue expectations were also lowered by 2.1% to $979 billion, although these figures still reflect record profits from the previous year’s $32.4 billion. IATA's Director General, Willie Walsh, emphasized that while the expected profit of $36 billion translates to a mere $7.20 per passenger per segment, such a narrow margin exposes the industry to potential future demand shocks. Decreasing oil prices and an increase in passenger numbers were noted as positive factors contributing to profit growth. Nonetheless, airline operations continue to suffer from unacceptable delays in aircraft deliveries, exacerbating challenges for carriers amidst rising costs of older aircraft maintenance.

This forecast was announced during IATA's Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, which marked the first meeting in India in 42 years. IATA's Director General, Willie Walsh, emphasized concerns related to supply chain disruptions and a backlog of 17,000 aircraft, highlighting the fragile nature of projected profits of just $7.20 per passenger. Despite these hurdles, airline revenues are anticipated to hit a record $979 billion in 2025, reflecting a 1.3% increase from 2024. In India, the aviation industry directly employs 369,700 people and is responsible for generating $5.6 billion of GDP, with broader impacts raising this total to 7.7 million jobs generating $53.6 billion in GDP.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nAirlines projected to report profits of $36 billion in 2025, an increase from $32.4 billion in 2024, according to IATA.

Key highlights include a projected net profit of $36 billion for 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024 but down from previous expectations. The net profit margin is expected to rise to 3.7%, while operating profits are estimated at $66 billion, and total revenues are set to reach a historical high of $979 billion. Passenger demand is expected to increase to 4.99 billion travelers, despite the impact of global trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence. Although jet fuel prices have decreased, regulations and economic conditions continue to pose challenges. The forecast also highlights regional profitability, with the Middle East expected to show the strongest margins at 8.7%, while Africa will likely see the weakest at 1.3%. Airlines are also called to remain vigilant against risks, including geopolitical tensions and fluctuations in oil prices.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nThe first half of 2025 has brought significant uncertainties to global markets... it’s a strong result that demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify, said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Despite this, IATA's chief economist, Brian Pearce, expects a gradual recovery starting in the second half of the year, particularly as some countries resume domestic travel. However, international travel remains uncertain, and many airlines may struggle to survive without significant governmental assistance, which could total $200 billion globally. The pandemic has also altered the landscape for both leisure and business travel, with potential long-term effects on pricing and demand. To facilitate recovery, IATA and Airports Council International have created a roadmap highlighting essential safety practices for resuming flights. This includes measures like contact tracing and contactless services.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\n\"We're going to probably lose an unprecedented [$84 billion in 2020],\" said Brian Pearce, chief economist for IATA. \"For many airlines, they do depend on international air travel,\" Pearce added. Keith Mason of Cranfield University noted, \"We're going to see a consolidation in the market where airlines that are fully independent are struggling to survive.\" Mason also stated, \"It's reasonable to assume that business travel may lose 1 in 5 trips.\" IATA and ACI developed a roadmap recommending practices for safely resuming flights.\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 9: Airlines - IATA ---\nURL: https://www.iata.org/en/youandiata/airlines/\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) serves to represent and support the global airline industry, comprising around 350 airlines in over 120 countries. Key services and programs outlined include membership requirements, safety improvements through the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), and strategies to enhance airline retailing and sustainability.

This financial issue arises from proceeds made in local currency being unable to return to airlines due to foreign exchange shortages. While the total amount of blocked funds had decreased from **$1.8 billion** in April 2024, nine countries are primarily responsible for 83% of the total blocked amount. These countries include **Pakistan** ($311 million), **Bangladesh** ($196 million), **Algeria** ($193 million), and others. IATA Director General **Willie Walsh** criticized this situation, stating that it significantly affects airlines' operational viability and could ultimately harm economies reliant on aviation. Some progress was noted, particularly with Nigeria clearing most of its blocked funds, but other regions, notably the XAF/XOF zones, are experiencing increasing amounts of blocked funds. Governments are encouraged to resolve these financial barriers swiftly to avoid negative impacts on the aviation sector.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nIATA reported that as of October 2024, governments had blocked the repatriation of $1.7 billion of airline funds. IATA Director General Willie Walsh stated, 'This unfortunate game of 'whack-a-mole' is unacceptable.'

This proposal, presented to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) ahead of its upcoming 42nd Assembly in October 2025, aims to reflect longer, healthier careers while maintaining safety safeguards. IATA also emphasizes the need for timely accident investigations, requesting states to adhere to ICAO Annex 13, which mandates that final reports be available within a year. Currently, only 57% of accident reports from 2018 to 2023 are publicly accessible, highlighting a critical gap in safety information. Additionally, IATA seeks enhanced global standards for aviation operations, particularly concerning Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and the protection of safety-critical radio frequencies from interference. The Assembly presents a key opportunity for states to align on pressing aviation issues.\n</summary>\n\n<key_excerpts>\nIATA supports lifting the multi-pilot limit to 67, retaining the existing cockpit safeguard of at least one pilot under 65, said IATA Director-General Willie Walsh. IATA asks states to complete accident reports in line with Annex 13 requirements and in a timely manner. The criticality of global standards to global aviation cannot be underestimated, noted Walsh. Targets for SAF use set by ICAO should be reviewed by states to consider the implications of setting mandates without increased production, IATA recommends. A functioning SAF market creation is essential, along with timely policy interventions, per IATA's proposals.\n</key_excerpts>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 17: Membership - IATA ---\nURL: https://www.iata.org/en/about/members/\n\nSUMMARY:\n<summary>\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) represents around 350 airlines, accounting for 80% of global air traffic.
